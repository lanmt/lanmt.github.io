## 1.介绍一下自己
>Dear Professors,
Good morning/afternoon/evening. My name is Meng Tian, and I am from Heze, Shandong. I am currently studying at Changchun University of Science and Technology. It is a great honor to participate in this interview, and I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce myself.
My undergraduate major is Software Engineering, where I have studied courses such as Operating Systems, Data Structures, Computer Networks, C++ Programming, and Java Programming. Due to my deep interest in computer science, I have consistently advanced my studies beyond the standard curriculum and achieved excellent results, ranking sixth in my major. As a side note, I chose 96 computer-related options when applying for universities after the college entrance exam.
Additionally, I dedicated a significant portion of my time during university to preparing for competitions. Our training was rigorous, and last summer, I stayed at school, maintaining a daily training schedule of ten hours. This hard work paid off, as I won eight national awards, including a gold medal at the China Collegiate Programming Contest National Invitational (Changchun), as well as several provincial awards. These achievements also secured my first-place ranking in the postgraduate recommendation list within my major. Through these competitions, I developed strong self-learning skills, a solid foundation in programming, and the ability to perform well under pressure. Moreover, I have consistently practiced reading problem statements in English, which has given me a good command of English reading comprehension.
Looking ahead, I aspire to work in the fields of operating systems or big data. If, during my graduate studies, my research abilities are recognized by my advisor, and my passion for the subject continues to grow, I would consider pursuing a Ph.D. My ultimate goal is to become a researcher, working in a university or research institute, where I can contribute to the field I love.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration!
