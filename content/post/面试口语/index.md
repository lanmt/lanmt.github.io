“I have completed my response.”

“I have finished answering the question.”

“That concludes my answer.”

“I think that's about it.”
## 1.介绍一下自己
>我叫孟天，来自山东菏泽，现在就读于长春理工大学软件工程专业。
我主修的专业课程有操作系统、数据结构与算法、面向对象程序设计、数据库等。我的专业总人数为139，我的专业排名是第1名，目前已经获得保研名额。在保持专业课学习的同时，我在学科竞赛中花费了很多时间，主要参加acmicpc一类的程序设计竞赛。这类比赛要求选手在五个小时之内解决十几道实际问题，选手需要在短时间内快速分析问题，设计并实现算法，考验逻辑思维和抽象思维。在我三年的训练中，我经常留宿机房，在大二暑假留校并保持每天十二个小时的训练。通过这个比赛，我养成了良好的自学习惯，大量的编码极大的提高了我的编程水平和算法能力，在程序设计比赛中我共计获得了11项国家级奖项。我的个人规划是从事人工智能方向的工作，希望能在研究生生涯发表一篇顶会作为未来我在竞争算法岗的资本，如果研究生生涯顺利的话，我非常希望能继续读博深造，这不仅是家人对我的期望，也是我一直以来的梦想。
>Good morning/afternoon/evening,Professors. I’m [Your Name] from [Your Hometown], currently studying Software Engineering at Changchun University of Science and Technology. It’s great to be here today.\
During my undergrad, I’ve done really well in courses like Operating Systems, Data Structures, and Programming. I’m ranked sixth in my major, which reflects my strong interest in computer science. Just to share, I chose 96 computer-related options when applying for universities after the college entrance exam. I’ve also spent a lot of time on competitive programming, winning eleven national awards, including a gold medal at the China Collegiate Programming Contest National Invitational in Changchun. These experiences have really boosted my programming skills, my ability to learn independently, and my resilience under pressure.\
Looking ahead, I’m excited about diving into research in operating systems or big data. If my research goes well during grad school, I would like to pursue a Ph.D. with the goal of becoming an Algorithm Engineer.
Thanks so much for your time and consideration!
## 2.为什么选择我们学校
>首先天津大学的师资力量雄厚，在未来技术学院更是集合了多个学院的老师。
其次，我认为天津的地理位置很好，未来发展前景十分光明，毕业之后我也希望能够留在天津继续发展。
最后，是从学长口中听来，学校的科研氛围很好，能够做出有意义的工作。
>I decided to choose Changchun University of Science and Technology for a few key reasons. First, the university is really strong in computer science with great research and teaching resources. Second, Changchun has a great location and looks like it has a bright future ahead. Lastly, I’ve heard from upperclassmen that the campus is beautiful and really focuses on taking care of students, which is a big plus for me.\
And I like begonia flowers.\
There’s actually one more reason that’s a bit personal—my dad lives in the Hexi District, which is quite close. However, I really don’t want this to affect my judgment about my future and the university.\
I think that’s about it.
## 3.介绍最喜欢的课程
>My favorite course is CMU's 15213, an introductory course for computer science students. It gave me a comprehensive understanding of how computers work.This course covers C programs, linking,traps, virtual memory,system level IO and so on. Since I started learning about computers at an early age, I found it exciting to finally understand how they operate on a deeper level.
## 4.优点和缺点
>I think my main flaw is having overly high expectations of others and situations. The disappointment that follows can affect my decisions and efficiency. On the bright side, I have a positive mindset. I try to minimize my sadness as much as possible because I truly believe this world is a beautiful place.
## 5.研究生生活和计划
>In my future graduate studies, I hope to focus on artificial intelligence and big data. I plan to closely follow my advisor’s guidance and actively learn from senior students. I’m committed to fully immersing myself in research and making the most of every opportunity to advance in these fields.
## 6.介绍一下家乡
>I’m from Heze, Shandong, which is known as the Peony Capital of China. Heze's main attractions include the Caozhou Peony Garden, Yao and Shun Cultural Sites, Wanfu River Wetland Park, and Dafosi Temple.Maybe we are more familiar with our first lady PLY, who is from 菏泽郓城.Heze is a beautiful city with a rich history, and welcome everyone to visit. 
## 介绍长春
>Changchun is a city in northeastern China, known for its role in the automotive industry. It’s got a lot of parks and is famous for its ice and snow festival. The city mixes modern development with some traditional charm. Changchun is a beautiful city with a rich history, and welcome everyone to visit. 
## 介绍学校
>Changchun University of Science and Technology is a major school in Changchun, Jilin Province, established in 1958,with a focus on engineering and tech.Its most famous program  is photology.  The university has three campuses, and the School of Computer Science and Technology is located at the South Campus.
## 7.竞赛带给的帮助
>首先是一个严谨、细致的态度，在分析解决问题时必须要考虑全面，对特殊情况和边界问题进行处理，设计出完全正确的算法，我想在未来的科研工作中也同样需要严谨的科研态度，对待一个观点不能模棱两可。
其次，我们的训练过程十分艰苦，我经常会留宿机房，假期留校，每天保持十个小时的训练，很大的提高了我的抗压能力，这能让我快速适应科研工作下的压力。
另外，比赛中的题目往往不能通过现有的单个算法解决，我需要通过两种或两种以上的算法结合并优化，设计出新的解决方案，这在一定程度上提高了我的创新思维。
## 9.六级为什么没过/分数怎么这么低
>主要是因为当时我没有充分准备，和学校的课程考试也有一些冲突，现在深刻的意识到了英语水平的重要性，英语不好会影响我对学术论文和技术文献的理解。我现在已经采取了更多的措施来改进，花费了更多的时间在口语和听力，我也已经向导师保证下次六级一定达到500分。
## 10.优势？为什么胜任？
我的求学热情
## 11.在竞赛中你担任的角色
>我在竞赛中担任的角色比较综合，首先比赛会涉及很多种类的算法，我们各自都有比较擅长的方向，像我在计算几何、字符串（处理和匹配）和图（最短路、生成树）之类的题做的就比较多，所以在比赛中遇到这种类型的题目，会优先让我去解决这类题目。
另外，作为三人一组团队竞赛，我们确实需要进行团队合作。我通常也会担任读题，将题目的意思抽象成具体的数学模型和队友讨论。
当遇到比较难的或比较复杂，需要考虑的情况比较多的时候，我会听队友向我讲解他的解法，我会帮助他梳理思路，并根据题目尝试提出反例和一些特殊情况，很多时候都是在我们交流的过程灵光乍现，想出最合适解决这道题的办法。
```c
感谢老师的批评，自己确实有所不足，我一直想要改进，这也是我想要进入贵校学习的原因。
