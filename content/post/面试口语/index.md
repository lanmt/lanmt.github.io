## 1.介绍一下自己
>Good morning/afternoon/evening,Professors. I’m [Your Name] from [Your Hometown], currently studying Software Engineering at Changchun University of Science and Technology. It’s great to be here today.\
During my undergrad, I’ve done really well in courses like Operating Systems, Data Structures, and Programming. I’m ranked sixth in my major, which reflects my strong interest in computer science. Just to share, I chose 96 computer-related options when applying for universities after the college entrance exam. I’ve also spent a lot of time on competitive programming, winning eleven national awards, including a gold medal at the China Collegiate Programming Contest National Invitational in Changchun. These experiences have really boosted my programming skills, my ability to learn independently, and my resilience under pressure.\
Looking ahead, I’m excited about diving into research in operating systems or big data. If my research goes well during grad school, I would like to pursue a Ph.D. with the goal of becoming a researcher at a university or research institute.
Thanks so much for your time and consideration!
## 2.为什么选择我们学校
>I decided to choose Changchun University of Science and Technology for a few key reasons. First, the university is really strong in computer science with great research and teaching resources. Second, Changchun has a great location and looks like it has a bright future ahead. Lastly, I’ve heard from upperclassmen that the campus is beautiful and really focuses on taking care of students, which is a big plus for me.\
And I like begonia flowers.\
There’s actually one more reason that’s a bit personal—my dad lives in the Hexi District, which is quite close. However, I really don’t want this to affect my judgment about my future and the university.\
I think that’s about it.
## 3.介绍最喜欢的课程
>My favorite course is CMU's 15213, an introductory course for computer science students. It gave me a comprehensive understanding of how computers work.This course covers C programs, linking,traps, virtual memory,system level IO and so on. Since I started learning about computers at an early age, I found it exciting to finally understand how they operate on a deeper level.
