## 1.介绍一下自己
>垃圾
>Good morning/afternoon/evening,Professors. I’m [Your Name] from [Your Hometown], currently studying Software Engineering at Changchun University of Science and Technology. It’s great to be here today.\
During my undergrad, I’ve done really well in courses like Operating Systems, Data Structures, and Programming. I’m ranked sixth in my major, which reflects my strong interest in computer science. Just to share, I chose 96 computer-related options when applying for universities after the college entrance exam. I’ve also spent a lot of time on competitive programming, winning eleven national awards, including a gold medal at the China Collegiate Programming Contest National Invitational in Changchun. These experiences have really boosted my programming skills, my ability to learn independently, and my resilience under pressure.\
Looking ahead, I’m excited about diving into research in operating systems or big data. If my research goes well during grad school, I would like to pursue a Ph.D. with the goal of becoming a researcher at a university or research institute.
Thanks so much for your time and consideration!
## 2.为什么选择我们学校
>I decided to choose Changchun University of Science and Technology for a few key reasons. First, the university is really strong in computer science with great research and teaching resources. Second, Changchun has a great location and looks like it has a bright future ahead. Lastly, I’ve heard from upperclassmen that the campus is beautiful and really focuses on taking care of students, which is a big plus for me.\
And I like begonia flowers.\
There’s actually one more reason that’s a bit personal—my dad lives in the Hexi District, which is quite close. However, I really don’t want this to affect my judgment about my future and the university.\
I think that’s about it.
## 3.介绍最喜欢的课程
>My favorite course is CMU's 15213, an introductory course for computer science students. It gave me a comprehensive understanding of how computers work.This course covers C programs, linking,traps, virtual memory,system level IO and so on. Since I started learning about computers at an early age, I found it exciting to finally understand how they operate on a deeper level.
## 4.优点和缺点
>I think my main flaw is having overly high expectations of others and situations. The disappointment that follows can affect my decisions and efficiency. On the bright side, I have a positive mindset. I try to minimize my sadness as much as possible because I truly believe this world is a beautiful place.
## 5.研究生生活和计划
>In my future graduate studies, I will strictly follow my advisor's guidance. I plan to be proactive in learning from my predecessors, building up my knowledge, and then fully immersing myself in research.
## 6.介绍一下家乡
>I’m from Heze, Shandong, which is known as the Peony Capital of China. Maybe we are more familiar with our first lady PLY, who is from 菏泽郓城.Heze is a beautiful city with a rich history, and welcome everyone to visit. 
## 7.我的优势/竞赛带给的帮助
>首先，三年的竞赛经历我养成了良好自学习惯和团队合作能力，比赛是三人一组，学校并没有给我们提供系统的训练，很大程度上靠自己的自学。
其次，竞赛题目需要快速分析问题、设计和实现代码，这对我的逻辑思维和抽象思维的训练非常有帮助。\
另外，在三年的训练中，我做了几千道题目，写了数万行代码，熟悉很多编码的tricks和如何优化算法的复杂度，帮助我更容易复现论文中涉及的算法。\
对于实际问题，我知道应该选用什么数据结构降低的算法复杂度。\
对于编码上的tricks，例如，如果一个数据只有0和1两个取值，我们就可以使用c++的bitset库表示，不仅可以使用位运算加速计算，此外，bitset的一个元素在内存中只占一位，原本四个字节的int，便可以存储32个数据。
>  Firstly, my three years of competition experience have helped me develop strong self-learning habits and teamwork skills. Since the competitions are team-based with three members each and our school didn’t provide systematic training, we largely relied on self-study.\
Secondly, the nature of the competition problems—requiring quick problem analysis, coding design, and implementation—has been incredibly beneficial for honing my logical and abstract thinking skills.   \
Additionally, over the three years, I tackled thousands of problems and wrote tens of thousands of lines of code. This experience has familiarized me with many coding tricks and how to optimize algorithm complexity, which makes it easier for me to implement algorithms from research papers.\
For practical problems, I know which data structures to use to reduce algorithm complexity. For example, if the data only contains 0s and 1s, I use C++'s bitset library. This not only speeds up calculations with bitwise operations but also saves memory, as each bitset element only takes up one bit. So, what would normally be four bytes for an int can now store 32 bits of data.
## 8.研究生计划
>首先，在确认导师后我会休息半个月的时间，然后准备英语六级考试。
入学之前，我会积极和导师沟通，向前辈学习，给自己制定更具体可行的学习计划。
在研 1 阶段，我会积极参加研讨会和会议等活动，扩宽自己的视野和思路，提升自己的研究和创新能力，为后续科研打下基础。
在研 2 阶段，我会积极参与课题研究和项目实践，我相信在学校浓厚的学术氛围中，我可以通过自己的努力发表一篇顶会。
在研 3 我会高质量完成自己的毕业论文，并找到一份实习工作。如果我的科研工作顺利并得到老师认可，我非常希望能够继续攻读博士学位，这不仅是家人对我的期望，也是我一直以来的梦想。
>First, after confirming my advisor, I plan to take a two-week break and then focus on preparing for the CET-6 exam.
Before starting my studies, I’ll actively communicate with my advisor, learn from my seniors, and create a detailed and practical study plan.
In the first year of my research, I’ll participate in seminars and conferences to broaden my perspectives and enhance my research and innovation skills, setting a solid foundation for future work.
In the second year, I’ll dive into research projects and practical work. With the strong academic environment at the university, I’m confident that my efforts will lead to a publication in a top conference.
In the third year, I’ll focus on completing a high-quality thesis and securing an internship. If my research progresses well and receives recognition from my advisor, I’m eager to pursue a Ph.D. This goal aligns with my family’s expectations and has been my dream for a long time.
## 9.六级为什么没过/分数怎么这么低
>主要是因为当时我没有充分准备，和学校的课程考试也有一些冲突，现在深刻的意识到了英语水平的重要性，英语不好会影响我对学术论文和技术文献的理解。我现在已经采取了更多的措施来改进，花费了更多的时间在口语和听力，我也已经向导师保证下次六级一定达到500分。
>The main reason for my low score was that I didn’t prepare adequately at the time, and there were some conflicts with my school exams. I’ve since realized how crucial English proficiency is, especially for understanding academic papers and technical documents. I’m now taking more steps to improve my skills, focusing more on speaking and listening. I’ve also promised my advisor that I will score at least 500 on the next CET-6.
