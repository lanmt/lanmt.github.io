## 1.介绍一下自己
>Dear Professors,
Good morning/afternoon/evening. My name is xx from xx, currently studying Software Engineering at Changchun University of Science and Technology. It’s an honor to be here today.
Throughout my undergraduate studies, I’ve excelled in courses like Operating Systems, Data Structures, and Programming, ranking sixth in my major due to my passion for computer science. As a side note, I chose 96 computer-related options when applying for universities after the college entrance exam.I also devoted much of my time to competitive programming, leading to eight national awards, including a gold medal at the China Collegiate Programming Contest National Invitational (Changchun). These experiences have strengthened my programming skills, self-learning abilities, and perseverance  under pressure.
Looking forward, I’m eager to delve into research in operating systems or big data. If my research proves successful during my graduate studies, I would consider pursuing a Ph.D. with the goal of becoming a researcher in a university or institute.
Thank you for your time and consideration!
